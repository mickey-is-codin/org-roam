* Daily - Monday, April 29, 2024

** EOD Brain Dump
 - brand list being infuriating
   - column width
   - external links with prevent default
 - everything else rebased and hopefully good to go

** Standup Notes
 - archive a sup
   - finished
   - think Simran's branch needs to be rebased
 - new setting
   - Chris branch needs to be merged
 - product search
   - should be all finished up
   - will be in touch with Kimia
 - noticed an issue where navigating to table pages causes URL spam
 - Testim documentation
 - out Thursday and Friday

** Dispatch Orders Setting
 - last i remember was needing to convert boolean to string
 - Chris' PR for this is still not merged
 - so i'm actually all set on it

** Product Search
 - need to check in with Kimia
   - end of last week she fixed the "title" issue
 - can probably locally do the wishlist removal
 - figure out how to work around type issues
 - need to remove wishlist on product description page
 - need to make filters work
 - need to make sorts work

** Archiving Supplier
 - odd behavior on my suppliers page: URL rapidly changing
   - checking on develop branch (happening there)
   - pulling develop then retrying (happening there)
   - same thing in incognito window (happening there)
   - on develop environment (happening there)
   - i'll make a ticket and assign to myself before moving on
 - i think Simran's branch will likely have to be rebased
   - due to Alex Whittaker updating product search stuff from ripping out feature flags
   - that will almost definitely fuck with my product search PR
 - fuck, can't just replace the table
   - Conner's suppliers table has different info
 - ok this is done
   - need to ask Chris or Simran to rebase
   - then should be good to make a PR and merge

** Morning Brain Dump
 - tickets
   - archive a SUP
   - product search
   - new setting
 - need to update my board to bring things over to next sprint
 - need to get Testim presentation ready for Wednesday
 - need to schedule QA for archive
 - need to schedule QA for product search
 - discover brand list view QA issues
