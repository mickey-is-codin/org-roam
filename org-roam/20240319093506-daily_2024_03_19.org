   - after Kimia gets BE up
 - finally take a look at brand list view
 - line item csv order download (thank you Kimia!)

** Morning Brain Dump
*** Read Receipts
need to check on that PR and merge if things are approved. otherwise continue PR approval process.

*** Badges
need to add logos on pages they should appear. first hurdle though will be the mutation for updating shopify shops.

*** Rate Limiting
Simon added me as a collaborator on a ticket for this. probably because of my complaints about Slack showing errors in the server.

*** Order Line Items CSV Download
Kimia seems to have unblocked this so i can get something together quickly for it.

*** Single Message for Trial Plan Users
should be able to start this but might be blocked by BE
