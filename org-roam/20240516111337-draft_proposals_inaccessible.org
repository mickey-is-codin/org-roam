** Thursday, May 16, 2024 Notes
 - smartlook notes
   - cart side panel opens up
   - user clicks "Review proposal"
   - links right to brand instead of ...?
   - i assume some sort of proposal page should open
 - code notes
   - offending component: ~src/components/shared/cart/CartBrandItem.tsx~
   - looks like the ~onSubmit~ function isn't acting right
   - looks like the code is doing what it should...
   - ~await openShopkeepRoute('discoverShop', shopId, { state: 'create' });~
 - desired behavior
   - even if is shopkeep just set review proposal
