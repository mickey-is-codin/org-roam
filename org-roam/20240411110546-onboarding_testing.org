* Onboarding Testing
onboarding is the process of an SK sending a SUP a referral link and then that SUP becoming a Canal SUP. the suppliers tab has an "invite" option that allows an SK to generate a referral link.

when accepting that link, locally it's easiest to onboard as a CSV shop since that prevents the need to create a new shopify store.
