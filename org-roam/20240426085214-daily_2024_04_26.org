** EOD Brain Dump
 - need to update hook to accept "other shop" for archiving, hook should get relationship
 - need to add ability to unarchive from actions in list view of suppliers
 - settings should be ready to actually get in, just need to accept boolean to finish
 - search should be top priority becaues Kimia is also working that
   - kimia put in title fix, need to wait for that to make it to develop
