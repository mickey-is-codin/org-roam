* Daily - Monday, April 15, 2024

** EOD Brain Dump
 - need to find more info on these fields for Kimia
 - discussion tomorrow on commission calculation
 - didn't look into E2E tests

** TestIM Notes
we're using this framework for E2E testing with the app. goal is for these to run on git pushes. perhaps a GitHub actions? should poll the team to figure out the exact scope for this.

** Kimia Context for Product Search Query
 - ~useGetDiscoverableProducts~
 - whether we use categories is feature flagged
 - feature flag can pretty much be turned off, it's default on everywhere
 - "what i want to know"
   - figured out what's actually used and what's not
   - SKDiscoverableProduct fragment
   - of all of these fields what's being used and what's not being used
   - in particular, is it used in the discover search
   - basically just come up with the minimal data to display the table
   - or not even that but just any fields that are straight up not used
 - 3 categories
   - totally used and in the table, we need it for results
   - need but don't need it until after search results
   - not being used at all

** Sprint Planning Notes
 - blocked but high priority
   - supplier setting
   - bulk proposals
 - can start
   - new resolver for sped upproduct discover search
 - commissions fixes
   - should put all into one ticket i think
 - end-to-end tests
   - work on it if nothing else in the way

** Standup Notes
 - country picker
   - seems like priority is growing
   - added search to PR
   - PR review and merge this?
   - next backend steps? Surya?
 - pre-populate proposal message
   - quick PR up
 - lots of blocked tickets
   - is there anything that i can prioritize?
 - E2E tests
 - use dimensions hook fix

** Asana Notes
 - pre-populate proposal message

** Morning Brain Dump
i should check in on what's going on with the referral commission situation with Simran and Wally.

we have sprint kickoff today so should make sure my board looks ok.

country picker can probably get merged today. looks like the title got updated on this to emphasize priority. kind of odd, didn't get any pressure on it at all when i was working on it but i'm sure it's a low stakes thing. but in general i'll try to work on the subsequent tasks a bit quicker. ...also i was on-call for almost the entirety of the ticket's lifespan and it sat unread in PR for like a week and a half.

still need to send that recording to Clay once Simon finishes it.

still want to review org-roam info manual page.
