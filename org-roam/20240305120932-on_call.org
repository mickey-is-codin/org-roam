on-call processes fit in with the process of determining bug priority.

results of ad-hoc bug reporting:
 - quality of the product is unknown (regressing or improving?)
 - engineering frequently interrupted by "high priority" bugs that interrupt workflows
 - product and go-to-market are frustrated that high-priority tasks fall away

bug-reporting process goals:
 - clarify how and where to report bugs
 - create a single repository of issues
 - provide sufficient details in every bug for an engineer to address them
 - don't distract all of engineering, just the ones who are on-call

good reasons to trade on-call shifts:
 - you expect to be offline during work hours PST during your shift
 - won't have access to high-speed internet for the duration of the shift
 - emergency

good to refer to the [[https://www.notion.so/shopcanal/Runbook-1554fa062ef74f69a0a1f0df74323088][runbook]] during on-call shifts

timeline for dealing with a bug can be determined based on [[id:e75510cf-8843-418d-9035-08ef6f67010c][bug-priority]].
