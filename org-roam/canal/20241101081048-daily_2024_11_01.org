** EOD Brain Dump

** Standup Notes

** Session Situation
*** Reproducing/Notes
 -

** Active Proposal Products Showing "Add to Proposal"
*** Reproducing
*** Side Notes
**** Partnership Weirdness
 - until i added a product to a proposal the view of my supplier account was different
 - only showed "available"
 - now i see "partnership"
 - though i think i do see the issue with "add to proposal"
**** Weirdness with Pricing
 - testing out some different configurations with variants, compare at price, etc
 - ended up just cleaning up column value calculation logic
**** Proposal View Product Table Numbers
 - Current: =$NaN-$NaN=, Proposed: =$NaN-$NaN=
 - had to update one of the ~getProductPriceFromVariants~ helper functions
 - now one actually supports numeric returns on the ~amount~ field
 - gonna clean up these invoking files a bit
**** "Added to draft proposal - view"
 - can't click on "View" button on product when it's in proposal from "My Suppliers"
 - ~pointer-events: ${({ $isSwipeable }) => ($isSwipeable ? 'auto' : 'none')}~
   - seems naive
   - my guess is this is meant to prevent "dragging" items
   - not only does this turn off "draggin" but also "clicking"
 - ~isSwipeable~ is being set to ~false~
   - that turns off ~pointer-events~
 - ~isSwipeable={isSwipeable && maximumTranslationX > 0}~
   - uhhh what is this trying to say?
   - if an item isn't all the way to the right in the carousel?
 - ~maxTranslationX~ seems to be the culprit
 - ~maxTranslationX = innerCarouselWidth - containerWidth + (shouldCenterSelectedItem ? containerWidth - currentItemWidth : 0);~
   - just "how far left an item can be moved?"
   - seems like ~containerWidth~ and ~innerCarouselWidth~ should be switched, no?
   - ~containerWidth - innerCarouselWidth + (shouldCenterSelectedItem ? containerWidth - currentItemWidth : 0);~
 - ~containerWidth~
   - width of the whole outer element: ~CarouselContainer~
 - ~innerCarouselWidth~
   - width of all items and the gaps between them i suppose
   - ~memoizedItems.length * widthAndGap - itemGap~
