* Proposal State Management Refactor

** Need
 - currently changes to the proposal form are very difficult
 - the state between sections is handled in a very awkward way
 - consistent messaging b/wn FE and BE would make this flow more easily
 - currently there is a bunch of repetitive code
 - that code is hard to maintain/change
 - and this is a frequently used/change requested area of the app

** Proposal (for Proposals)
 - possibly managed with reducers?
   - similar to management used for tiktok affiliate campaign creation UI
 - make proposals unique URL, not just local state
 - better section state handling
 - UI components/tools that let a dev make a page that "looks like a proposal" easily
   - e.g., canal affiliate target collaborations
