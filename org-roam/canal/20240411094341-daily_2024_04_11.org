** EOD Brain Dump
 - referral commission issue
   - still have not referred
   - need to seriously consider reproduction steps
 - country picker
   - only note from Alex visually was change all countries to white

message Kimia about prod dump

** Standup Notes
 - plaid link token PR merged
 - Molly flagged an issue with referrals in onboarding
   - going through this a bit slowly
   - just want to make sure that i'm able to recreate referral process really well
   - actually creating a shopify shop, etc
   - seeing "develop supplier" is under review
 - inventory not showing up when viewing uninstalled suppliers
 - worked on storefront filter in supplier order page, that's merged

** Morning Brain Dump
 - molly ticket about commissions
   - this blocked her reproducing uninstall state issues
 - can probably merge storefront filter PR
 - country picker continue work
 - don't remember otherwise -- need to triage on-call and Asana stuff
 - could probably clean up my Asana tasks generally
   - check assigned to me and bug board
