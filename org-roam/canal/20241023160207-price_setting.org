* Price Setting

** Shopify
 - two fields to set =original price= on a given variant: =compare at price=, and =price=
   - if =compare at price= is set
     - =original price= of variant is =compare at price=
     - =discount price= of variant is =price=
   - if =compare at price= is not set
     - =original price= of variant is =price=

** Canal
 - a combination of =original price=, =sale price syncing=, and =canal price= is used to calculate =default price=
 - if =canal price= is on and =sale price syncing= is off (we don't sync sale price)
   - =canal price= is calculated from =original price= and stored on =default price=
 - if =canal price= is off and =sale price syncing= is off
   - ?
 - if =canal price= is off and =sale price syncing= is off
   - ?
 - if =canal price= is on and =sale price syncing= is on
   - ?

** Canal Price
 - turned on if two fields are set:
   - =round adjusted price to=
   - =price adjustment percent=

** Sale Price Syncing
 - an override that allows Canal to use =discount price= instead of =original price=
 - overridden if =default allow sup sale price passthrough= is set

** Difference for SUPs and SKs
*** SK
 - =default price= is the price that a variant should be
*** SUP
 - =default price= is the price that a variant should be for an SK
 - =price struct= is the =original price= of a variant
   - no =sale price syncing= accounted for
   - no =canal price= accounted for
*** Questions
 - can the BE send the same variant to an SK and a SUP with different =default price= values?
