** Thursday, March 21, 2024 Notes
 - feature flagging
   - wondering if it would make sense to add the actual DB feature flag during QA
   - that way i could ask Garrett and the design team which shops to enable for
 - QA session

** Wednesday, March 20, 2024 Notes
 - feature flagging
   - enabling locally via CMS
   - need to ask a BE engineer if more needs to be done for that when merged
   - simon-sk-6 should not see the feature
   - simon-sk-5 should see the feature
   - whoops i'm going about this wrong
   - i should enable it for simon-sup-6
   - then when i view simon-sup-6 it will show
   - when i view simon-sup-16 it won't show

** Tuesday, March 19, 2024 Notes
 - mutation
   - have the mutation working with no fragment
   - need to see if i can return status
   - though it seems like the hook should handle that
 - restore/toast behavior
   - trying to figure out the best way to handle this for a first pass
   - my gut tells me conflicting things
   - state probably shouldn't save to the server until the "restore/undo" modal goes away
   - but want to start saving right away to make loading times short
   - we can add an additional control that dismisses the banner on save
   - then restore after that
 - questions for PR
   - where should constants go?
   - where should hooks go?
   - where should helper functions go?
   - was mutation well-handled?

** Monday, March 18, 2024 Notes
 - badge down a pixel
   - on Friday got the badge showing up but it's ever so slightly shifted down
 - update:
   - got badges displaying with modal on homepage
   - need to figure out best modal practices for reproducibility
   - need to figure out backend interactions
   - perhaps extract something like a ~<BadgeStatusBanner~ component
     - that could include the modal as well
     - and could define whether or not the banner is dismissable

** Friday, March 15, 2024 Notes
 - going to just test out some components to see how they look...
 - profile page banner
   - looks like this should be in ~ShopProfilePageHeader~
 - need to figure out how Yanni's SVG is supposed to work for this
 - currently blocked by getting the SVG
   - will just save that in the public directory
   - then it looks like we can just nest an image inside it

** Thursday, March 14, 2024 Notes
 - think it makes sense to just add the subtasks as commits
 - i believe we only want this on the supplier page
 - how to manage permanently that the homepage banner dismissed?
 - put the banner in profile above listed products
 - path to supplier profile page: ~src/components/supplierapp/discover/SupplierProfilePreview/index.tsx~
 - could try to use a ~Banner~ component
 - Jess just showed me how to sort of trace components within Figma which should speed my searching up

** Wednesday, March 13, 2024 Notes
 - there are 3 subtasks within this. will probably have to make pages for tracking those
   - edit/view badges on own profile
   - view badges on other profiles
   - homepage modal
 - questions:
   - what is the difference between a "badge" and a "tag"?
     - it looks like we're more looking at something like tags
     - probably not worth bringing up but eh
   - seems like it would be fair to say that badges are like "statuses for shops"
   - extremely explicit in this idea seems to be mimicking LinkedIn's "#open to hiring" badges
   - is there any backend work that's been finished on this?
   - this feature will in general require me to learn more about event-tracking within the app
 - full badges workflow:
   - from home page:
     - dismissable version of the same banner petition
     - both banners dismissed once filled out
   - from profile page:
     - banner displaying petition to add badges
     - banner includes profile logo with badge added to it
     - clicking a badge brings up a modal
     - this modal lets you add a description and the badge to your profile
     - "set your status"
     - selecting a badge and confirming shows a toast message: "Status saved"
     - status now shows with badge in profile along with edit pen
     - text can overflow
     - profile avatar now shows badge

*** Jess Discussion
my understanding of the workflow:
 - on homepage a user sees a banner that is dismissable
 - it's not there if they've already added badges for their profile
 - on profile page user sees a banner until badges are added
 - if a badge is clicked in the banner a modal opens
 - the modal gives badge options and a description to update status
 - updating badges causes editable view to show in banner section
 - updating badges causes profile to include badge text

questions:
 - event tracking?
 - "'open' does not get a profile logo badge"?
