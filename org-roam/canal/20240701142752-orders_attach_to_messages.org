* Orders Attach to Messages

** Monday, July 8, 2024 Notes
 - having a bit of trouble with this because i'm not sure my local orders are realistic
   - will ask Simon about stubbing these better
 - need to figure out if search by customer can work
 - perhaps this will be easier to just test in dev environment

** Tuesday, July 2, 2024 Notes
 - summary:
   - dropdown allows you to select an order to attach to a message
   - when sending a message from an order this auto-fills
   - selecting an order pre-fills subject line
 - questions:
   - which orders should show up in the box?
   - what surfaces should this be available on?
     - from brand profile
     - from order
   - what surfaces should this not be available on?
   - ~myOrders~ or ~shopifyOrders~?
   - should both SKs and SUPs see this?
