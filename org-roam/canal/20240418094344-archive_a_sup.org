** Tasks
*** DONE submit PR
*** DONE merge PR

** Wednesday, May 1, 2024 Notes
 - copy change
   - just need to change "Unarchive" to "Move from archive"
 - all, active, pending tabs should not include archived SUPs
   - i think these are BE updates needed entirely
 - text on button change without refresh
   - can't reproduce this at all so i think it should be fine


** Tuesday, April 30, 2024 Notes
 - kind of tough to change sidebar tabs
 - need to make sure we re-fetch suppliers when archiving or removing from archive
   - checking dev behavior
   - yeah no dev doesn't re-fetch
 - remove from suppliers should "unarchive" (done)
 - archived should have archive icon (done)
 - change active shops to filter out archived ones?
   - definitely
   - ah Simran already did this
 - =need to ask BE to fix count of active to exclude archived=
 - consideration:
   - should removing from My Suppliers "unarchive"?
   - archive information becomes useless at that point
   - and if you add them back you wouldn't want them in the archive
   - making exec decision on this

** Wednesday, April 24, 2024 Notes
 - Simran's branch name: ~simran/apr/archive_sup~
 - what "Remove from My Suppliers" does:
   - runs mutation ~toggleShowInMySupsView~
   - Simran's PR removed this mutation i believe
 - Simran conversation notes:
   - archiving is going to just be another boolean
   - "another" because previously ~shouldShowInMySuppliersView~ was there
   - odd, seems that she removed that mutation
   - the conversation would imply that she just updated an arg that could be sent to it
   - ok no i'm dumb she said she would switch to the patch mutation
   - so no need for this mutation to exist at all
   - but which patch does she mean?
   - ~spyglassSkSupRelationshipPatch~
   - :hermmm:
   - odd that ~spyglass...~ but oh well
 - first step, add the ability to archive:
   - "My Supplier" checkmark button
   - should probably alter the hook ~useToggleShowInMySuppliersView~
     - allow archiving as well as removal
     - probably need to rename it
 - important question!!:
   - does this change imply the ability to archive a storefront too?
   - kind of need it too with Simran's change?
   - actually no that's not necessarily true
   - but still have to alter that other hook
 - wondering if Simran should update endpoint to only accept "other shop" id

** Thursday, April 18, 2024 Notes
 - likely need:
   - mutation to archive the SUP
   - conditional logic to check archive status on the shop
 - interesting, functionality is an SK archiving a SUP
   - so they're archiving the partnership itself
 - visual
   - clicking the "My Suppliers" checkmark button
     - drops down to second "Archive" button
   - My Suppliers page has an archive icon
     - filters to show archived suppliers
   - archived suppliers shouldn't show in any other tabs
   - if archived, dropdown "Move from archive" and "Remove from My Suppliers"
   - toast on action completes
   - more button in My Suppliers table also allows "Unarchive" and "Remove from My Suppliers"
