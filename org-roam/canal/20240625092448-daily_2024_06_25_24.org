** EOD Brain Dump

** Standup Notes

** Null Inventory Commission
 - what could make commission show nothing:
   - no value for ~maxSkCommissionAsPercentage~ and ~minSkCommissionAsPercentage~
   - zero variants?

** Homepage Widget and My Suppliers Page Queries
 - homepage my suppliers widget:
   - ~shopifyShops~
 - my suppliers page:
   - ~loggedInShopifyShop.connectedSupsForSk~
 - issue:
   - my suppliers page uses ~relationshipStatusAsSk~ for status filter
   - can't supply "WISHLIST" to this field
   - so until then can't do anything on the homepage
 - files:
   - ~src/components/overview/shopkeep/sections/MySuppliers/tables/WishlistTable.tsx~
   - ~src/components/shopkeepapp/suppliers/MySuppliersPage.tsx~

** Uninstalled Profile Issues
 - the entire ~SupplierProfile~ component isn't rendering
 - interesting lead on ~shopProfileContent~
   - conditions:
     - if you're in the shopkeep app show sup content
     - if you're both shopkeep and sup app AND not on suppliers page AND not in list view show both content
     - if you're looking at a supplier show sup app
     - otherwise show sk content
   - something has to be going weird here
 - observation:
   - if ~isASupProfile~ is ~false~ nothing shows up
   - ~isASupProfile~ is determined via ~shop.appsInstalled~
 - hypothesis:
   - the entire point of this ticket is that the SUP uninstalled...
   - this is returning false causing nothing to return
   - we probably need to predicate ~isASupProfile~ on something else
   - because we still need to show supplier information like the table
