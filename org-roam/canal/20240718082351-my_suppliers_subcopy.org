wanted to get a document out to spread out all of the rules that we have for this page.

** Rules
 - if you are an SK viewing the “My Suppliers” page:
   - if you have products approved and added to your store show ‘Products added to store’
   - if you have available products but they aren’t added to store show ‘Add products to store’
   - if you have a proposal out that is pending show ‘Products pending approval’
   - otherwise show nothing
 - if you are a SUP viewing the “My Retailers” page:
   - if you have pending products show ‘Review proposal’
   - if you have a pending partnership show ‘Partnership pending approval’
   - if you have an existing, approved partnership and products approved but they’re not added to store show ‘Products not yet added to store’
   - if you have an existing, approved partnership and products approved and added to store show ‘Products added to store’
   - otherwise show nothing
