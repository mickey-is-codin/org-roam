* Bulk Proposal Ideating - 9/30/24

** Motivation
product wants the "add brands" modal to be able to search all brands. i remember strongly that this is impossible based on table specs. i need to investigate to remember exactly why.

** Setting/Context
 - 14 suppliers in discover for Mickstopher Storefront
 - discover page size: 10 - ~src/components/shopkeepapp/discover/results/constants.ts~
 - bulk proposal brand table page size: 5 - ~src/components/shared/proposals/CreateBulkProposalPage/constants.ts~
 - add brands modal page size: 10 - ~src/components/shared/proposals/ProposalForm/AddBrandsModal/index.tsx~

** Current Code Review
 - for ~ShopListViewItems~ page:
   - ~shopIdsToInclude~:
     - if "select all" (~selectionMaskValue~), empty list
     - otherwise manually selected rows within single page
   - ~shopIdsToExclude~:
     - if "select all" (~selectionMaskValue~), manually *de-selected* rows within single page
     - otherwise empty list
 - for ~CreateBulkProposalPage~:
   - just propagate values for ~shopIdsToInclude~ and ~shopIdsToExclude~
   - ~onAddSuppliers~:
     - just ~toggleSelection~ set those brand IDs to ~true~
   - ~onRemoveSuppliers~:
     - just ~toggleSelection~ set those brand IDs to ~false~
   - note:
     - these callbacks seem sort of naive/dangerous
     - but we should be able to trust ~toggleSelection~ to be aware of ~selectionMaskValue~
     - confirmed in the code

** Fix TODO
 - use ~usePaginatedQuery~ for ~useGetBulkProposalBrands~
 - make new hook ~useGetAddableBrands~
 - add search bar for use with ~useGetAddableBrands~
