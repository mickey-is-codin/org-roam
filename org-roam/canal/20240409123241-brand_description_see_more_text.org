** Notes
 - looks like this is due to how we determine to show the text
 - checks the actual HTML element to see if it's truncated...
 - seems like something we could add a general abstraction around
 - i know it would've been useful for partnership status reasoning
 - recreated
   - make page big
   - refresh so text goes away
   - make page small
   - see more button gone
