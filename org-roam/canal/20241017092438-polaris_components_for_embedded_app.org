* Polaris Components for Embedded App

** Auth Changes Summary
 - new shopify auth middleware added:
   - in embedded app:
     - JWT token refreshed before every request (set in cookies)
     - JWT token set on request headers before every request
   - in standalone app:
     - JWT token checked before every request (get in cookies)
     - if JWT token present set on request headers
     - if JWT token not present don't set it on request headers
 - link from non-onboarded embedded app to standalone app:
   - ~{environment-aware-app-url-base}/onboarding/shopify/supplier/account~
 - link from onboarded embedded app to standalone app:
   - ~{environment-aware-app-url-base}/supplier~
   - =this link refreshes JWT token before navigating=
 - BE had to update ~settings.py~ to work locally:
   - ~CANAL_APP_NAME_TO_PK~
   - ~CANAL_APP_NAME_TO_URL~

** Embedded App Workflow
*** Not Onboarded
 - user opens Shopify Admin
 - we check for Canal session: they have none
 - we give them a team admin login: ~admin+myshopifydomain.com@shopcanal.com~
 - we check if they're onboarded: they are not (no ~canalContactEmail~, ~hasAgreedToToc~ is ~false~)
 - since they're in embedded app they're met with ~IncompleteEmbeddedSupplierApp~
 - user hits "Connect Canal account"
 - we check their session for shop information (=TODO=)
   - is there shop information exposed from Shopify or something to set on the session?
 - we redirect them to standalone app at ~/onboarding/shopify/supplier/account~
 - they complete onboarding and mess around in the standalone app
*** Onboarded, Logged In
 - user who is logged in to the standalone app in another tab opens Shopify Admin
 - we check for Canal sessions: they have one
 - we check if they're onboarded: they are
 - they're met with ~CompleteEmbeddedSupplierApp~
 - user hits "Go to Canal account"
 - they're brought to the homepage of the standalone app
*** Onboarded, Not Logged In
 - users who is not logged in to the standalone app in another tab but is onboared opens Shopify Admin
 - we check for Canal sessions: they have none
 - =ony difference= we give them a team admin login: ~admin+myshopifydomain.com@shopcanal.com~
 - we check if they're onboarded: they are
 - they're met with ~CompleteEmbeddedSupplierApp~
 - user hits "Go to Canal account"
 - they're brought to the homepage of the standalone app

** Questions
 - when onboarding completes does it complete for the user as well as the team?

** Random Notes
 - if shop not onboarded, ~AppWrapper.tsx~ is what forces the redirect to onboarding
 - onboarding complete definitions:
   - supplier:
     - shop has a name
     - shop has an email
     - team has agreed to TOS
     - shop has set supplier commission
   - retailer:
     - shop has a name
     - shop has an email
     - team has agreed to TOS
 - showing onboarding instead of embedded homepage
   - nesting: ~<AppWrapper>~ -> ~<AppContainer>~ -> ~<CanalApp>~
   - ~<AppWrapper~ runs effect that redirects to onboarding
   - ~<CanalApp>~ displays embedded homepage
   - we likely want this logic in ~_app.tsx~

** Tuesday, October 29, 2024
 - check embedded before onboarding compete
 - figure out why we're redirecting to "shopkeep" onboarding
 - map out onboarding/login logic
 - flow:
   - first open canal supplier app in shopify admin
   - greeted with polaris connect to canal page
   - hit "connect to canal"
   - brought to standalone app supplier onboarding page
     - * here we need to know what shop you came from *
     - set session within FE before navigating to standalone
   - complete onboarding and use standalone app
   - visit app after onboarding
   - important question: are you logged in?
   - we assume you're logged in just by being in the embedded app
   - but if you have a session we should use that session

** Overall Goal
Shopify has threatened to delist our app unless we use Polaris components to represent our app's embedded experience on the Shopify app.

** TODO buttons and links

** Questions
 - when to show "not connected"/"complete"
 - how to determine listed product counts?
 - how to determine acceptance of terms & conditions?
 - how to store/display illustration?
 - how does uninstall work from unembedded app?
 - supplier/shopkeep split?
