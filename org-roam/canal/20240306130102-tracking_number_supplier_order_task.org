* Add Tracking Number to Supplier Order

[[https://app.asana.com/0/1199696369468912/1205969713055176][ticket link]]

** DONE add supplier support

** Summary
similar to [[id:2e40ed66-412d-499b-9515-2ac0e85d28f4][asana-ticket-expose-customer-email]] but we need to extend this further to include:
 - carrier service used to ship the item
 - the tracking number sent out by that carrier service
 - the fulfillment date of the order

** Thursday, March 7, 2024
*** Initial Fact-finding
 - it looks like ~fulfillmentDate~ isn't present on the model
 - asking Simon about this
 - Simon is going to try to get a branch up
*** Bookkeeping
 - updated the ticket to ask Molly if i can make ticket blocked
 - mentioned that Simon is working on a PR
*** Assumption
 - ~trackingNumbers~ and ~trackingUrls~ are arrays
 - i'm going to posit that both are paired by index

** Friday, March 8, 2024
*** Current Status
 - Simon's dump works great
 - able to see that my changes are working for flattening
 - still need to fix the date formatter
 - still need to center the Contact button
