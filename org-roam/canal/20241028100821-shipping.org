* Shipping

** Shipping Relationship Copy
*** Explanation Copy
=How much will you charge your customer and contribute to the Supplier to cover shipping costs? If you do not plan to charge the shipping or cover costs, put a flat rate of $0.=

   - =Your customers are charged the shipping rate from the Supplier's website=
 - =Custom flat rate=
   - =Your customers are charged a flat rate for the Supplier's products=
*** Pay the Supplier Copy
 - =(Recommended) Supplier's dynamic rate=
   - =You pay the Supplier the shipping rate from their website=
 - =Custom flat rate=
   - =You pay the Supplier a flat rate for their shipping costs=
*** Notes
 - shows up when SK makes proposal to SUP
 - Supplier surfaces a rate that shipping for a given good truly /costs/
 - Retailer can:
   - let the customer pay that
   - take the shipping cost out of the commission they make on the sale (?)

** Initial Thoughts, Questions, Musings
 - retailers sell stuff, suppliers...supply stuff
 - so user buys something via retailer, then the thing is shipped via supplier
 - shipping has a "dynamic" and a "static" option within the app
 - dynamic/static nature of shipping is defined within proposals (SK -> SUP?)
