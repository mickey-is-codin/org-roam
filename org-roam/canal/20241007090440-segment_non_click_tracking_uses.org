* Segment Uses Outside Click Tracking
 - obviously it's used for click-tracking but Jess, Molly want to know if we do anything outside that with it
 - segment even can be run any time
 - they're certainly attached to ~onClick~ handlers a lot, but we use them for other things too
 - worth mentioning that they don't indicate /clicking/ but can be attached to an action related to clicking
   - often predicated on getting a BE response back
 - examples:
   - ~openShopkeepUrl~
   - ~trackSupplierFinalStep~
   - ~SHOPKEEP_MADE_SALE_IN_PAST_30_DAYS~
   - ~trackCreateProposalPageLoaded~
   - ~MOMENT_BANNER_VIEWED~
   - ~SHOP_VIEWED_PARTNERSHIP_REQUEST_MESSAGE~
   - ~SHOP_VIEWED_BRAND_WITH_PENDING_PARTNERSHIP~
   - ~SHOPKEEP_SAW_UPGRADE_PLAN_MODAL~
