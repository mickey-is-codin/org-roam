* Nordstrom Images

** Tuesday, November 12, 2024
   - sounds like Surya is in today, wants to improve pre-processing (reduce manual load)
   - need to build manual tool no matter what
   - Clay been working on endpoints, etc

** Implementation Notes
 - libraries:
   - drag-n-drop: ~react-dnd~
   - image cropping/basic editing: ??

** Spec Notes
 - URL: ~/shopkeep/edit-images/<supplier-id>~
 - only visible in god-mode
 - page should show, for a supplier, all products =approved= AND =added to store=
 - each page is specific to a product
   - display pool of images =product image pool=
   - allow dragging to reorder in =product image pool=
   - display section for each variant
   - allow dragging to assign to =variant image set=
   - allow dragging to reorder =variant image set=

** Questions
 - possible URL scheme? ~/shopkeep/edit-imaegs/<supplier-id>/<product-id>~

** Nordstrom Image Guidelines
 - first image white/gray background
 - first image no text
 - first image no lifestyle
 - 2:3 aspect ratio
 - minimum 3 images per variant

** Team Discussion
 - what it needs to do
   - allow cropping
   - allow restoring to image in history
   - allow image reordering at product level
   - allow image assigning to a variant
   - allow image reordering at variant level
   - allow deleting image
 - go at a supplier level
 - show every product they're approved for and added to store
 - solutions:
   - combination of what we've built and some external tool
   - mirakl says "hey suppliers, you have to fix your images"
     - Marisa has done this, started reaching out to suppliers
   - godmode into nordstrom sk account and use the sk-side tool
 - caveat
   - we found with smart cropping turned on was just adding white borders to top/bottom
   - so if we use smart cropping it'll have to be updated/fixed
 - what we've done
   - turned off "remove background" from first batch (smart cropping)
   - hand curated images so far
   - what Surya built got us easy images suppliers
 - what is the problem?
 - scale
   - approved for 26,000 products
   - Clay estimated something like 500...?
   - every product has to have 3 images
   - 78,000 images then
   - roughly 40% of images seem ok
   - so probably about 30,000 images need to be addressed
   - something like 52 suppliers total
 - questions:
   - we've already built some things...are these accessible in the app?
     - sounds like it but we're not using all of them



** Possibly Useful Query
