* HerStory Commissions Issue

** Wednesday, April 3, 2024 Notes
   - summary:
     - 100% commission for herstory
     - listings page for products showing 43% commission
   - where does that 43% come from?
     - is "desired commission" different than agreed commission?
   - "desired commission" is specific to a brand for their partnerships
     - their ideal commission when making partnerships
   - investigating
     - other brands not seeing this issue in the table
     - tough to track because lots of partnerships result in the desired commission
