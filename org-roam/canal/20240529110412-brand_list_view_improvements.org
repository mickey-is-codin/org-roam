** Tasks
*** DONE complete ticket

** Thursday, May 30, 2024 Notes
 - going to leave the last three tasks for this undone
   - i think truncating values will solve most of Katherine's issues
   - and table cell width is far more complicated than anything else
   - still don't know what ticket this goes under though

** Wednesday, May 29, 2024 Notes
 - overview:
   - [ ] product description should be two lines
   - [ ] ellipse categories to give description more room (use designs for space)
   - [ ] get all spacings right
   - [X] loading state look more like a table
   - [X] return policy button
   - [X] limit categories to 3
   - [X] should remember that it's in list view
   - [X] hover state on brand values
   - [X] row supposed to change colors on hover
   - [X] gap between categories and table
 - return policy modal
   - condition for that to not open is invalid return policy URL or no return policy URL
   - confirm that with Katherine
 - remember grid or list view
   - probably worth adding a URL param
   - but that could be awkward with table state
   - should ask Conner
 - table hover state
   - this was just disabled lol
 - table loading state
   - uggggh
   - ended up doing something kind of awkwardly manual
