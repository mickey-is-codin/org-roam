# How We Display Product Availability

## Overview

Our system determines how to display the availability of a product or its variants based on several factors. The display varies depending on whether we're showing a single product, multiple variants, or if the product is in a special state like being unlisted, paused, or rescinded.

---

## Display Differences Between Top-Level Products and Variants

### Single Variant or No Variants
- **Scenario:** The product has no variants or only one variant.
- **Display:**
  - **In Stock:**
    - If inventory management is not enabled (`inventoryManagement` is `null`), we display **"In stock"**.
    - Tooltip: *"Inventory tracked on a different platform."*
  - **Exact Stock Count:**
    - If inventory is managed and the stock count is above the threshold, we display **"X in stock"**, where **X** is the available quantity.
  - **Out of Stock:**
    - If the stock count is at or below the threshold and selling when out of stock is not allowed (`inventoryPolicy` is `"deny"`), we display **"Out of stock"** in a prominent color.
  - **Backorder:**
    - If the stock count is negative but backorders are allowed (`inventoryPolicy` is `"continue"`), we display the negative count with a tooltip explaining the backorder status.

### Multiple Variants
- **Scenario:** The product has multiple variants.
- **Display:**
  - **Aggregated Stock Count:**
    - We sum the stock counts of all variants with inventory management enabled.
    - Display **"X in stock for Y variants"**, where **X** is the total stock and **Y** is the number of variants.
  - **In Stock Without Counts:**
    - If the total stock is zero but at least one variant doesn't have inventory management, we display **"In stock"**.
  - **Out of Stock:**
    - If the total stock is at or below the threshold and no variants allow backorders, we display **"Out of stock"**.
  - **Backorder:**
    - If the total stock is negative and at least one variant allows backorders, we provide a tooltip explaining the backorder status.

## What We Display for Every Product State

### Unlisted Products
- **Condition:** `isUnlisted` is `true`.
- **Display:** **"Unlisted from Canal"**
- **Tooltip:** Information about the unlisted status and possibly a contact option for the supplier.

### Paused Products
- **Condition:** `isPaused` is `true`.
- **Display:** **"Product paused"**
- **Tooltip:** Details about why the product is paused and how to proceed.

### Rescinded Products
- **Condition:** `isRescinded` is `true`.
- **Display:** **"Product rescinded"**
- **Tooltip:** Explanation of the rescinded status with potential next steps.

### Zero Variants Found
- **Condition:** The product is expected to have variants, but `variants.length` is `0`.
- **Display:** **"Zero variants found"**

---

## Edge Cases That Might Show Up

- **Inventory Management Disabled:**
  - If `inventoryManagement` is `null` for a product or variant, we consider it always **"In stock"**.
  - Tooltip provides context that inventory is tracked elsewhere.

- **Negative Inventory Counts:**
  - When stock counts are negative and `inventoryPolicy` is `"continue"`, indicating backorders are accepted.
  - We display the stock status with a tooltip about backordering.

- **No Inventory Data:**
  - If inventory data is missing entirely, we default to displaying **"In stock"** or handle it based on other available information.

- **Threshold Differences:**
  - The threshold for considering a product **"Out of stock"** may vary between suppliers and retailers (`isSupplierView` affects this).

---

## Logic for Displaying Aggregated Information

- **Summing Variant Stocks:**
  - We calculate the total available stock by adding up the stock counts of all managed variants.
  - Variants without inventory management are not included in the sum but can affect the stock status display.

- **Determining Stock Status:**
  - **In Stock:**
    - Total stock is above the threshold, or inventory management is disabled.
  - **Out of Stock:**
    - Total stock is at or below the threshold, and no variants allow backorders.
  - **Backorder Possible:**
    - Total stock is negative, but at least one variant allows selling when out of stock.

- **Threshold Calculation:**
  - We use the lowest value from `inventoryThresholds` to determine the threshold for stock warnings.
  - For suppliers, we might set the threshold to zero, meaning any positive stock is considered **"In stock"**.

By applying this logic, we ensure that the availability display is informative, accurate, and provides necessary context to the user, whether they are a supplier or a retailer.
