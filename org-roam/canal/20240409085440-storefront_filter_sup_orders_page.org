** Wednesday, April 10, 2024 Notes
 - Conner URL params message:
   - =since you're querying for storefront ids, when you reload there is a brief period where the query hasn't returned and so any shopkeep ids are treated as invalid since the table will check against the possible filter values returned to it by that query=

** Tuesday, April 9, 2024 Notes
 - similar to the storefront filter on Insights but multi-select instead of radio buttons
 - seems very similar to the fulfillment status filter but it's based on table data...
 - perhaps the insights page will be helpful
   - uses a hook to get storefronts: ~useGetConnectedSksForSupTableFilter~
 - oddness, might need a BE engineer
   - table filtering works
   - works by setting ~shopkeepIds~ in ~tableFilterInput~
   - but when i refresh, ~shopKeepIds~ gets stripped from URL
 - waiting on Conner to give info on this
