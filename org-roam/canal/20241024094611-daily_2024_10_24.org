** EOD Brain Dump

** Standup Notes
 - copy update for shipping modal
 - copy update for payment cadence
 - canal price segment event
 - price setting figuring
 - polaris logicking

** Striked-Through Sale Price
 -

** Canal Price
 - created [[id:a432345e-5479-4ba1-8131-834924180c8e][price-setting]]
 - still an issue with Canal Price that Surya and Molly were discussing

** Surya, Wally, Garrett Session ID Notes
 - summary of issue
   - when user is brought to standalone app for onboarding
   - they should be logged in as admin user (i think?)
   - currently they're not logged in as anyone
   - so token not sharing for supplier accounts from embedded to standalone app
 - Surya:
   - we should link people out and then in standalone app create a new user
   - link to a page that refers to the shop ID
 - Wally:
   - concern that a random person could get a shop ID and start making users
 - Surya:
   - how do we do basically that exact flow for BigCommerce?
 - Wally:
   - the way Shopify does
   - Shopify lets people create users from within the embedded app experience
   - while they are authed (as admin?) and the shop ID is defined
   - random note: there is some Bearer token logic
 - Garrett:
   - what about WooCommerce?
 - Wally:
   - WooCommerce uses a different mutation
   - shop doesn't exist when they get to the page
   - it gets created along with the user when they fill out the form
 - Surya:
   - why can't they create an account in Shopify (embedded experience)?
 - Wally:
   - would have to make Polaris component signup flow
 - Garrett:
   - maybe we create a token on hitting "Connect Canal account"?

** Supplier Canal Flow
 - user/SUP searches for "Canal Supplier" app on Shopify app store
 - install "Canal Supplier" app
 - met with ~IncompleteEmbeddedSupplierApp~ (ft. Polaris components)
 - hit "Connect Canal account"
 - leads to ~/onboarding/shopify/supplier/account~
   - =this is where we're having trouble=
   - when we land on that route there's no trail to the shop ID
   - Surya attempting to fix
 - user is brought to standalone app where they complete onboarding
 - user plays around in app
 - any time they return to shopify admin "Canal Supplier" app they're met with ~CompleteEmbeddedSupplierApp~ (ft. Polaris components)

** Shipping Modal Copy Ticket
 - confusion
   - what is the "shipping modal"?
   - supposed to add new subcopy
   - that copy seems to imply there is an input field
   - "shipping modal" referenced elsewhere in Asana has no input:
     - ~ShippingChangeModal~
   - =left a ticket comment=
 - context from Molly
   - https://canalspace.slack.com/archives/C02920Q48HE/p1724695161504519?thread_ts=1724427983.632749&cid=C02920Q48HE
   - need to make sure subcopy is aligned between onboarding, proposals, and desired terms
 - thread notes
   -

** Morning Brain Dump
 - really liking The Sin-Eater by Fiona MacLeod
 - might try to figure out a path to helping document the app, make like a FE dev wiki
