 - ticket request
   - when we query ~numProductsInRequest~ the application is running out of memory
   - so we want to just use ~canalvariantrequestlineitemSet.totalCount~ instead
 - my confusion:
   - everywhere we use ~numProductsInRequest~ we're checking if it's the same length as ~cvrliSet.edges.length~
   - it seems like those will never be different if we just use ~totalCount~
   - but...i have no idea why we're comparing those quantities in the first place
