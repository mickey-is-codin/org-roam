* Django Admin

django admin is the CRM tool that Canal uses.

CRM = Customer Relationship Management. the goal of a CRM is to allow a business to handle customer data in a way that fixes issues or resets things appropriately for them without having to sit down with a customer or imeratively fix something directly in the DB.

CMS = Content Management System. these acronyms can be a bit confusing because both seem to be used to refer to django admin.
