 - things to calculate:
   - ~supplierCommissions~
     - ~shopkeepCommission~ is ~overrideShopkeepCommission~ or ~approvedShopkeepCommission~ or ~defaultShopkeepCommission~
     - fee is ~supServiceFee~ or ~SERVICE_FEE~
     - result is ~1 - shopkeepCommission - fee~ for each variant
     - =ultimately we get the min and max of these values=
   - ~shopkeepEarningsRange~
     - ~shopkeepCommission~ is ~overrideShopkeepCommission~ or ~approvedShopkeepCommission~ or ~defaultShopkeepCommission~
     - result is ~priceStruct * shopkeepCommission~
   - ~supplierEarningsRange~
     - ~shopkeepCommission~ is ~overrideShopkeepCommission~ or ~approvedShopkeepCommission~ or ~defaultShopkeepCommission~
     - fee is ~supServiceFee~ or ~SERVICE_FEE~
     - result is ~priceStruct * (1 - shopkeepCommission - fee)~
