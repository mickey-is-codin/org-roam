** Tuesday, April 30, 2024 Notes
 - getting a 400 error when i hit "Update"
   - looks like input variables might not be getting added, i'll log everything out
 - net earnings not saving
 - email sharing not default expanded

** Thursday, April 25, 2024 Notes
 - awkward refetching and re-mutating for every setting section
   - we should just fetch all the necessary shop settings at the global level
   - then each section just chooses which to pluck and which to mutate
   - the mutations honestly can stay as they are
   - but one big query to fetch
 - develop email behavior:
   - ah ok, the sub-option is literally just a 3rd option
