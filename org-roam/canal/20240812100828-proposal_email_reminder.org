* Proposal Email Reminders

** Monday, August 12, 2024 Notes
 - task overview:
   - change timing of ~ProposalExpiresSoonRecipientEmail~
   - change timing of Kaili proposal follow up
   - change copy of Kaili proposal follow up
   - create another from-Kaili email
 - questions/issues:
   - i think BE ultimately needs to be who updates actual email send timings
   - where is the "Kaili proposal follow up" email?
   - where is ~ProposalExpiresSoonRecipientEmail~?
   - think i have to be added to our Postmark account
   - very likely that one or both of these templates just exist there online
 - template names:
   - ~ProposalExpirationAuto1~
   - ~ProposalExpirationTeamMember1~
   - ~ProposalExpirationAuto2~
   - ~ProposalExpirationTeamMember2~
   - ~ProposalExpirationAuto3~

** Templates
 - from canal: right when proposal is sent [no change] (donâ€™t need to know)
 - from kaili: 3 days later (~Kaili proposal follow up~, change copy, change name)
 - from canal: 8 days later (~ProposalExpiresSoonRecipientEmail~)
 - from kaili: 16 days later (New template created per subtask)
 - from canal: 19 days later (~ProposalExpiresTomorrowRecipientEmail~)
