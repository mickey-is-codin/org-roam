** EOD Brain Dump

** Standup Notes
 - Molly, saw that you added tasks around brand list view
   - does that need immediate action?
   - how is the feature flag working for that?
 - read receipts
   - sigh
   - consolidated the logic around determining read receipt
   - so it always comes from the container
   - lots of logic around last message type
   - i'll want to get in touch with a BE eng to see how much of this could be ported to BE
   - but priority is immediate fix
 - uninstalled profile quick loading state fix
 - badges merged
 - calendar merged
 - this afternoon looking at country picker hopefully
 - on call starting tomorrow

** Morning Brain Dump
main thing i want to have done to start the day is the read receipt issues that i promised i would get in early.

fulfilled by fixes that Wallace suggested.

Molly wanted something copied over to SUPs that i did early.

then nothing blocking country picker.
