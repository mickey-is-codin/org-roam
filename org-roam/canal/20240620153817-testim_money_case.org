* Tesim Money Case
 - we have a philipino agency that we work with for 15 per hour
   - if we use them 30 min a day
   - quoted us at 3k a year to test the app
 - lots of experience with other frameworks
   - cypress
   - playwright
 - we would be under 500 runs a month
 - lambdatest is $99/month
   - how are you differentiated there
 - frustration with working in testim already and getting screwed
   - switching up pricing
 - CEO joking about price increase with investor friends about quoting for 500 runs/month
 - not wanting to waste resources on managing them, just want a simple software
