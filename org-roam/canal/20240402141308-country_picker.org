** Questions
 - should it be a modal?
 - how deep should the "panama-ification" of things go?
   - just the overall modal?
   - ~CountryDisplay~?
   - ~FlagLogo~?

** Tuesday, April 2, 2024 Notes
 - design is describing this as a specialization of a "brand picker"
   - ~ProductListings.tsx~?
 - important: include flag to turn off subdivision
   - first pass of this will exclude states/subdivisions of countries
 - there's a ~SelectProductsModal.tsx~ that i think should be inspiration
   - it makes use of ~SelectItemsTable/index.tsx~
 - implementation woes
