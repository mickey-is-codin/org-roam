** EOD Brain Dump

** Standup Notes
 - on-call
   - fix copy for EDI onboarding
   - no referral account creation loading state
   - struggling with dropdown sizing for state field
 - country picker
   - EOD yesterday worked on making it /recursive/
 - read receipts
   - think Chris finally set me straight
   - probably good to do some final testing on that

** Morning Brain Dump
got some [[id:4797cb9f-b54d-4873-b48c-575aa7bb756e][on-call]] stuff that needs to be taken care of.

continuing work on country picker.

did read receipt stuff get merged? will check and have Jess test.

going to order a charging HDMI and expense it.

need to take a look at referrals commission unlocking since that should be unblocked
