** Morning Brain Dump
need to think of a way to prank Molly, possibly Ben. Ben is in town, need to look into events that we could do together, possibly check New Yorker.

end of last week i was really just kind of ironing out stuff around badges and the calendar so should check if those are ready to go to develop. badges need to see sign off from Jess and Garrett then calendar i think is just good to merge as soon as Jess says so.

first on call shift this week. that actually kind of blows for movie week and Ben being in town but oh well.

oh also need to finalize my movie list.

GitHub state:
 - uninstalled state not merged
 - badges not merged
 - calendar not merged

Ben ideas
 - Haam, Williamsburg - vegan Trinidadian food
 - baby's all right
   - cab ellis
   - takuya nakamura
 - enemy of the people
 - young fathers
 - whitney biennial
 - Moma
 - Brooklyn Museum 100 views of Edo
 - metrograph
 - Japan society
 - minetta lane (dead outlaw)
 - Here theater - ten transcendental etudes
 - film forum
   - le samourai
   - classe tous risques
   - limbo
 - soho gallery tour

need to move all my Sprint stuff over so i don't look a fool.

need to start on the messages from orders feature that's in my Asana.
