* Proposals Refactor

** Needs Statement
there are lots of areas in the app that we initiate and edit proposals. we're doing a lot of code repitition when we do this which means that things aren't standardized and reusable. what parts we're using that /are/ being reused are being reused more because of the arcane nature of their behavior and code rather than reusing them because they are useful. i think we should update the proposal flow so that, any time a designer asks us to add a proposal section to the app we are excited instead of scared!

** UX Notes
 - possible abstraction paradigm
   - UI crossover between proposals and onboarding
   - multi-step UI with multiple pages (onboarding, campaign creation)
   - multi-section page (proposals, campaign creation)

** Codebase Research
*** UI Components
**** Proposal (Multi-Section Page)
***** ~<ProposalForm>~
****** ~<InnerProposalForm>~
******* ~<ProposalFormLayout>~
******* ~<SectionsList>~
******* ~<Section>~
**** Onboarding (Multi-Step Pages)
***** ~<ProgressStep>~
*** Places That "Proposal UI" Shows Up
 - ~<ProposalForm>~
   - creating a proposal
   - creating a "bulk" proposal
   - creating a "counter" proposal
   - "editing" a proposal
   - "resending" a proposal
   - "renegotiating" terms
   - "renegotiating" products
   - (kind of) canal affiliate campaign creation
