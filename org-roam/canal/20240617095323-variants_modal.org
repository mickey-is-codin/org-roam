* Variants Modal

** Wednesday, July 31, 2024 Notes
 - commissions
   - overall shopkeep commission
     - (supplier view) for some reason sk commission is just...different (26 my branch, 30 develop) ask Toby about this
     - (shopkeep view) all looks good except i'm seeing a 0% where there's a N/A on develop
   - your commission
     - (supplier view) 69% on my branch, 65% on develop
     - (shopkeep view) N/A there shouldn't be anything
   - net earnings
     - (supplier view) seems calculated similarly but percentages are different
     - (shopkeep view) way too high. seems to be multiplying by 30 instead of by .30
 - testing now that i know how table works
   - BE: ~minSkCommissionAsPercentage~ and ~maxSkCommissionAsPercentage~ calculating across all shops,not just partner
   - supplier view: commission is editable on activated product, "your commission" goes away
   - supplier view: add button showing in actions on activated product

 - questions:
   - remove the count of variants? and in availability column?
   - where should this work? every products table?
   - what is "list on canal"?
