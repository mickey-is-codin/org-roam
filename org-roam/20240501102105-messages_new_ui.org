** Existing Inbox Notes
 - left-hand filters are query params
   - ~containerId~ from selecting a message
   - ~brands~ based on filter option
   - ~category~ from clicking left-hand filters
   - ~filter~? seems very unused, permanently set to ~all~?
   - ~search~? can't find a way to make this work either
 - layout components we're working with
   - ~ProposalsPreviewList~
     - ~CommunicationContainers~
     - ~CommunicationContainer~
   - ~CommunicationContainerView~
   - ~MessageModal~

** New Inbox Notes/Ideas
 - layout components that would make sense (listen to design for names!!!)
   - ~ProposalsPreviewList~
   - ~CommunicationContainerView~
   - ~MessageModal~
   - ~Folders~? ~Categories~? new left sidebar, cuz old sidebar is now full page
 - message preview states
   - rest
   - hover
   - active
   - unread
   - with read receipt
   - attachment

** Wednesday, May 1, 2024 Notes
 - looks like the actual page of a conversation is largely unchanged
   - except for the fact that there's a back button
   - this brings you back out to the overall inbox
 - inbox currently defaults to first message
   - need to remove that behavior
 - need to move search bar into messages area
 - current search bar behavior (does it filter down the previews on the left?)
   - yes
 - general strategy
   - make "home" page only show ~ProposalsPreviewList~
   - redesign ~ProposalsPreviewList~
 - updated strategy
   - clone the ~ProposalsPreviewList~
   - one version of it will always be there (this allows styling for ~CommunicationContainersView~ to work)
   - the other version is full width and will be dismissed when a message is selected
