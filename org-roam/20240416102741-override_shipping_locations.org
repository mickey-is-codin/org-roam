** Tasks
*** TODO complete ticket

** Summary
currently shipping locations for a shop come from their Shopify profile. we need to add an ability to override that within the app. beyond that, we don't have a field to allow non-Shopify shops to designate where they ship to. goal is in profile previews to see "ships to (1/2/etc) countr(y/ies)".

** Thursday, April 18, 2024 Notes
 - going to actually start out on this today
 - i can do some of the UI but of course not actually make any of the network requests
 - but can set up the CountryPickerModal to open with the ~useGetCountries~ data

** Tuesday, April 16, 2024 Notes
 - honestly this feels almost entirely blocked by BE
 - should get in touch with Surya about what he needs to make BE work
 - because the FE implementation will very much be dictated by what he comes up with
*** Design Notes
 - info on right side of shop profile
 - bit confused how "Countries [brand] ships to" should show up
 - update brand details modal has "Ship to countries" section with Edit button
 - that opens Country Picker
