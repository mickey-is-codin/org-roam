** EOD Brain Dump
 - PR up for SFCC prevent "sale price syncing" sections
 - PR merged for SFCC external link in inventory
 - p1 bug with Chris -- orders page request empty string
 - need to follow up on read receipts stuff with Chris
 - badges QA session turned up bugs
 - feature flags big PR

** Standup Notes
 - read receipts
   - end of last week worked on fix for this
 - line items CSV download merged
 - fulfillment info on orders for /suppliers/ merged
 - badges
   - QA session today
   - so i guess requesting PR review on that
 - brand list view
   - merged to develop
   - do we want to do a quick QA session on that?
   - in general is default feature flag behavior turned off?
 - today sfcc external link removal
   - kind of using this as a GQL best practices punching bag
   - Simon had to clean up a fragment definition for me
   - s/o merging to frontend repo
 - uninstalled profile view blocked...i think?
 - taking a look through other sprint tickets

** Misc Notes
 - migrations are failing locally
   - trying to run migrate with manage.py is throwing an error
   - i feel /very/ confident that this could be solved with a dump
   - going to do that and hope i don't mess anything up
 - if a ticket has no due date should i just avoid doing it?
 - Jess noting issues that are not regressions with RRs
   - 1 left panel shows request as last message
   - 2 sample requests don't show read receipts on left
   - first one a bit harder because it requires frontend date comparison
 - p1 ticket for empty supplier ids
   - ~src/components/shopkeepapp/orders/components/Table/index.tsx~

** Morning Brain Dump
looked like some bugs this weekend around fulfillments. all P2s but i should check out the warroom channels for things there. Simon also had to do some cleanup on one of my fragments in a PR so i want to go about getting really opinionated about how fragments should look in the codebase.

today i think we finally have the actual badges QA session. should also likely come with a QA session for the brand list view. i believe that view should be turned off but i'll need to make prod feature flags for both. i think the default behavior if you have a gated feature and don't make a feature flag is that the feature just won't show up so hopefully we're good there.

line item download PR should be good to merge, two approvals on it.

need to finally get started on uninstalled profile state.

=want to schedule coffee meetings with FE team=
