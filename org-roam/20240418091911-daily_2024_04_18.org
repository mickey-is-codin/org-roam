** EOD Brain Dump

** Standup Notes
 - testim setup
   - created an actual test
   - setup a GitHub action
   - need to figure out accounts + billing
 - archive a SUP
   - PR by EOD
 - think product search resolvers are ready
   - will move over to those
 - change countries ship to
   - finished locally but no mutation to set that
   - accusation: found out that Wally added ~countries.json~

** Morning Brain Dump
made good progress on Testim.

next Testim steps:
 - split tests into local and develop
 - figure out billing and account usage
 - write documentation for adding a test

unblocked on archiving a SUP.

should possibly be unblocked on country selection via the json useCountries hook.
