** Monday, April 1, 2024 Notes
 - good first ticket of the week task i'm thinking
 - existing piece of copy "Fulfilled by our friends at <sup>"
   - should go at the /end/ of product descriptions
     - this is handled by backend
   - copy should be controlled via settings
 - note: Conner added a bunch of styled components to this directory, use em
 - looks like that line of text is literally sent as HTML by the BE
   - comes on ~bodyHtml~ on ~ShopifyProduct~
   - now predicated on ~show_fulfilled_by_message_in_pdp_setting~
 - [[https://github.com/shopcanal/canal/pull/8194][link to BE PR]]
 - gist of ticket:
   - add section to settings page
