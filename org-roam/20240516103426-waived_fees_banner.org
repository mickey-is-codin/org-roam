** Thursday, May 16, 2024 Notes
 - ticket background
   - =AirMail has been seeing the [banner] even though they do technically have a monthly fee against their floor=
     - hmmmmmm
     - this seems like it could be a weird nuance
     - perhaps the UI is working but has to take something new into account
   - not showing up on the supplier's end when they actually do have waived fees
     - this seems like more of a specific bug i guess?
   - bringing up terms being the same
   - seems to me like that wouldn't be pertinent information but idk
   - Marisa thinks this could be a partnerships bug
 - implementation
   - how to determine banner:
     - does a shop's list of referral shops include this shop?
     - if so is the referral end date later than today?
 - feature background
   - i don't really know anything about this feature
   - seems contextually that fees are waived and this banner shows up if you're referred
   - ah so if you refer a shop then this banner should show up on that shop
 - hmmmm i'm an adult, i can check the prod CMS right?
   - though i might need like a spyglass link or something to see
 - questions:
   - Marisa: do supplier waived fees also work based on supplier referring someone?
   - Marisa: in our app domain, does referring someone mean /all fees/ are waived?
   - Marisa: if an SK sees waived fees banner for a SUP, should that SUP see it?
 - question: how do supplier waived fees work?
   - are we meant to check if the supplier has referred someone?
   - this would be exactly the same and there's no issue in that case
 - Marisa discussion:
   - should base this on transaction fees being 0 instead of referrals
   - Marisa thinks we should probably remove the banner in the SK app entirely
