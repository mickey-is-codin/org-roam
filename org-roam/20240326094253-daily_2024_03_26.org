** EOD Brain Dump
 - read receipts seems to have gotten fixed by Chris
   - but for that still need to add read receipts?
 - badges stuff all finished except dismissing homepage banner
   - waiting on Garrett for that
 - feature flags PR is up

** Conner Chat
 - what makes you tick outside of work?
 - how do you like how you're utilized at Canal?
 - do you write code in your free time?
 - do you picture yourself in SF longterm?
 - what's your favorite video game / album / book?

** Standup Notes
 - read receipts
   - spent some time identifying P2 where sample requests behave weird in container
   - found a way to make them behave the same as proposals
   - but it seems like it would need a BE change
   - would also probably get read receipts in with that
 - badges
   - QA session went very well
   - odd behavior where no mutations were working only on develop
   - need to make a banner go away permanently, do we have a pattern for that?
   - working on other easy fixes today
   - finished with almost all of them
 - some SFCC supplier PRs merged yesterday
 - feature flags
   - Conner made a new file and i want to support that

** Morning Brain Dump
gonna write a fun goodreads review for Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell first thing. also at some point want to do some work on the statement of work for EZ-Leasing...but honestly could just do that after work.

Chris commented in the warroom for the read receipt issues.

read receipt issues:
 - container no read receipt on sample requests
 - container not showing previews for messages after requests/proposals

badges fixes need to go in this morning

want to work on feature flags at some point
