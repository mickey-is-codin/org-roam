 - investigating proposal blocking
 - key to the kingdom: ~useCanInteractWithBrand~
 - list of "Message" buttons
   - suppliers page

 - where should logic live?
   - everywhere that a "message" button appears?
 - my guess of implementation
   - update ~MessageButton~ to not display if:
     - user is trial plan
     - recipient is not who invited them
 - proposals
   - proposals are already limited to one per brand
   - i should be able to recreate some very similar logic
   - hopefully they're using the modal appropriately

** Wednesday, March 20, 2024 Notes
 - not sure if BE is finished with what blocks this
 - ~shop.canalPlan~
 - plan types:
   - ~'CANAL'~
   - ~'TRIAL'~
 - i assume BE will be filtering queries that show "who a user can message"
 - BE has not gotten to this yet
