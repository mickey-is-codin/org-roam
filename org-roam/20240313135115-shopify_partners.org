 - Simon said his go-to develop sup is: https://partners.shopify.com/1892775/stores/66496659730
 - both of those links 404 for me
 - going to partners.shopify.com
 - asking me to create a partners account
 - created one
 - now at the actual homepage
 - seeing one Development store
 - Simon says i'm in the wrong org
 - where orgs show up i just see "create partner account"

Simon asked if i have access to Shopify partners so i figure having a note will be helpful for me being able to get up and running to more effectively test the app.

Surya recommends creating 2 Shopify apps and 2 Shopify stores, then connecting a store to each app.

i am just so confused. had to add a Partners account but now that i'm in that i'm seeing one store listed as Development. when i log into that i think i'm brought to one store. is that a supplier? is that an SK? who knows?

Simon indicating that i might not be in the right org
