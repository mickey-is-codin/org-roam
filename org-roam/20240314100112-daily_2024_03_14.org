* Daily - Thursday, March 14, 2024

would be smart to get started on actual implementation for badges. while i'm blocked on banner for read receipts getting some code written for that would be very very smart.

** EOD Brain Dump
the fkng types aren't working again on the ~MessagesContainer~. need to address that, hopefully in a way that's graceful. the inheritance structure for this GraphQL code is a complete clusterfuck with all of the type borrowing that goes on uggh. this will be a good chance for me to do a rundown and figure out all of the types that are happening here and figure out the whole inheritance scheme. i think the ultimate answer will be that i have to split off my own new fragment for my work and not borrow any old ones.

** Frontend Engineering Weekly
 - permissions:
   - set certain parts of the app off limits to people who don't need to be there
   - include a predicate function based on the current ~session~ value
   - ~CanalApp.tsx:322~
   - if you reach that page from a button include a wrapper
   - but just navigating they should just get bounced
   - other place you get bounced from is a specific proposal
   - that's page-by-page
 - vercel graphql allow list
   - no longer need to make a separate PR for your mutations
   - anything coming from develop on vercel is allowlist-ed

** BE Scoping Meeting
 - my ticket came up that i made for Chris lol
   - sounds like it should be easy it's a 5
 - "install app"
   - this was a clone of the one at the FE scoping meeting
   - suppliers see a button that says "install app"
   - and it directs them to install a storefront app
   - ...what does this mean actually?
 - datadog dashboard updates
   - the office dashboard
   - dashboard is meant to show if we're down
   - but the status page should eventually take that over
 - onboarding task list
   - tasks to complete
   - proposals to respond to
   - etc
 - trial plan users not message more than one brand
   - this is also from the frontend ticket
 - bulk add to store support masked selections
 - add finances to Stripe
   - most of our money is in bonds
   - taking money out of there is bad
   - not sure how putting money into stripe circumnavigates
   - but it lets the bonds continue to compoud
 - bulk proposal stuff
   - similar to bulk add to store
   - not exactly sure what's going on here
 - override shipping locations for supplier profile
   - this was in the frontend meeting too
 - storefront settings
   - show "fulfilled by our friends at"
 - respond to messages via email
   - would responding to the email actually hit the API?
   - some sort of hook?
   - mention of "inbound webhook"
   - scoped to just messages?
   - for sure that would be easiest at first
   - people are really excited at proposal approval
   - Garrett made a task for that right now
 - accept proposal via button in email
 - default relationship commission
   - default value for that relationship
   - apparently there are lots of defaults for commission

** Brain Dump
Chris got in touch last night about [[id:01413422-3bec-450b-b825-5c8e547794e2][asana-ticket-read-receipts]]. i'm still going through that and figuring out what needs to be done for the types. i think a good plan of attack for this morning would be to just iron out everything going on with read receipts up to the banner before i do anything else.

the last thing that happened with read receipts yesterday was seeing read receipts on every message instead of the last one and i think that was just a scoping issue. perhaps starting over one more time wouldn't hurt.

hopefully there's some movement on my [[id:0bebcb50-695c-4f21-8a05-de435d034272][asana-ticket-tracking-number-supplier-order-task]] ticket. ok cool Conner approved. not sure if i should wait on additional approvals but i'll bring it up at standup.

** Standup Notes
 - tracking number on supplier order PR is up
   - approved by one person
   - still not sure what ettiquette there is for that
 - read receipts
   - discussion yesterday around banner indicating that read receipts will happen
   - have the UI finished up to the banner itself
   - thanks to Chris for helping me get acquainted with the API!
 - badges
   - did some basic walkthroughs of the UI with Jess
   - have not implemented much yet
   - want to get plugging on this once read receipts are at a good stop
 - order line items CSV download
   - got S3 access so can actually download locally
   - don't think there's a ticket yet for BE to convert REST endpoint to GQL
   - is that something that i have license to create?
